        The universe is incredibly vast and mysterious. One interesting fact is
        that there are more stars in the observable universe than there are
        grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. It's mind-boggling! ðŸŒŒðŸŒŸ
      </p>
      <p>
        The universe is about 13.8 billion years old, but we can only observe a
        tiny fraction of it due to the speed of light.

        Black holes can be both incredibly massive and incredibly small. Some
        are as tiny as a single atom but contain the mass of a mountain!

        There's a phenomenon called "dark matter," which makes up about 27% of
        the universe's mass, yet we can't see or detect it directly. It's a big
        cosmic mystery.

        The Hubble Space Telescope has captured images of galaxies that are
        billions of light-years away, showing us what they looked like in the
        distant past.
